## Getting and Cleaning Data Project
Repo for the submission of the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data course.

### Overview
This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for further
analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

[The source data for this project can be found here.](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

### Changes to the script before Running
You should change the setwd argument(set the working directory) to the directory in which the UCI HAR Dataset is kept at the line 20 of the code- run_analysis.R


### Project Summary
The following is a summary description of the project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

### Extra Information
You can find the additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.md file.
